Climate Scientist, Data Scientist

I am currently exploring the nexus between energy transition and technology. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
My academic interests centers on dynamics and variability of weather and climate. Keywords of my past work include climate modeling, paleoclimate, monsoon, land-atmosphere interaction, and temperature extremes. 

I earned my Ph.D. in climate dynamics from University of California, Berkeley. My dissertation, advised by [Professor John Chiang](https://pages.github.berkeley.edu/jch-chiang/webpage/), seeks to understand and predict the seasonal transition of summer monsoonal precipitation in East Asia. I received my postoctoral training at University of California, Los Angeles. During my postdoc, I collaborated with [Professor Karen McKinnon](https://karenamckinnon.github.io/) (UCLA) and [Dr. Isla Simpson](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/islas) (NCAR) to understand roles of land surface conditions and large-scale atmospheric processes in affecting moments (variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of near-surface air temperature over land.
